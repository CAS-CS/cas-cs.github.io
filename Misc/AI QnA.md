A list of frequently asked Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions and Answers is given below:

### 1) What do you understand by Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial intelligence is computer science technology that emphasizes creating intelligent machine that can mimic human behavior. Here Intelligent machines can be defined as the machine that can behave like a human, think like a human, and also capable of decision making. It is made up of two words, "Artificial" and "Intelligence," which means the "man-made thinking ability."

With artificial intelligence, we do not need to pre-program the machine to perform a task; instead, we can create a machine with the programmed algorithms, and it can work on its own.

2.  **Unsupervised Learning:** It is a type of machine learning in which the machine does not need any external supervision to learn from the data, hence called unsupervised learning. The unsupervised models can be trained using the unlabelled dataset. These are used to solve the Association and Clustering problems.
3.  **Reinforcement Learning:** In Reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with its environment by producing actions, and learn with the help of feedback. The feedback is given to the agent in the form of rewards, such as for each good action, he gets a positive reward, and for each bad action, he gets a negative reward. There is no supervision provided to the agent. Q-Learning algorithm is used in reinforcement learning.

### 13) What is Markov's Decision process?

The solution for a reinforcement learning problem can be achieved using the Markov decision process or MDP. Hence, MDP is used to formalize the RL problem. It can be said as the mathematical approach to solve a reinforcement learning problem. The main aim of this process is to gain maximum positive rewards by choosing the optimum policy.

MDP has four elements, which are:

*   A set of finite states S
*   A set of finite actions A
*   Rewards
*   Policy P<sub>a</sub>

In this process, the agent performs an action A to take a transition from state S1 to S2 or from the start state to the end state, and while doing these actions, the agent gets some rewards. The series of actions taken by the agent can be defined as the policy.

***

### 14) What do you understand by the reward maximization?

Reward maximization term is used in reinforcement learning, and which is a goal of the reinforcement learning agent. In RL, a reward is a positive feedback by taking action for a transition from one state to another. If the agent performs a good action by applying optimal policies, he gets a reward, and if he performs a bad action, one reward is subtracted. The goal of the agent is to maximize these rewards by applying optimal policies, which is termed as reward maximization.

Turing test is one of the popular intelligence tests in Artificial intelligence. The Turing test was introduced by Alan Turing in the year 1950. It is a test to determine that if a machine can think like a human or not. According to this test, a computer can only be said to be intelligent if it can mimic human responses under some particular conditions.

Game theory is the logical and scientific study that forms a model of the possible interactions between two or more rational players. Here rational means that each player thinks that others are just as rational and have the same level of knowledge and understanding. In the game theory, players deal with the given set of options in a multi-agent situation, it means the choice of one player affects the choice of the other or opponent players.

Game theory and AI are much related and useful to each other. In AI, the game theory is widely used to enable some of the key capabilities required in the multi-agent environment, in which multiple agents try to interact with each other to achieve a goal.

Different popular games such as Poker, Chess, etc., are the logical games with the specified rules. To play these games online or digitally, such as on Mobile, laptop, etc., one has to create algorithms for such games. And these algorithms are applied with the help of artificial intelligence.

The RL-based system mainly consists of the following components:

*   Environment: The environment is the surrounding of the agent, where he needs to explore and act upon.
*   Agent: The agent is the AI program that has sensors and actuators and the ability to perceive the environment.
*   State: It is the situation that is returned by the environment to the agent.
*   Reward: The feedback received to the agent after doing each action.

In RL, the agent interacts with the environment in order to explore it by doing some actions. On each action, the state of agent gets changed or sometimes remains the same, and based on the type of action, and he gets a reward. The reward is feedback, which may be negative or positive based on the action.

The goal of the agent is to maximize the positive reward and to achieve the goal of the problem.

Bayesian networks are the graphical models that are used to show the probabilistic relationship between a set of variables. It is a directed cycle graph that contains multiple edges, and each edge represents a conditional dependency.

Bayesian networks are probabilistic, because these networks are built from a **probability distribution**, and also use probability theory for prediction and anomaly detection. It is important in AI as it is based on Bayes theorem and can be used to answer the probabilistic questions.

***

### 50) What is a heuristic function, and where is it used?

The heuristic function is used in Informed Search, and it finds the most promising path. It takes the current state of the agent as its input and produces the estimation of how close the agent is from the goal. The heuristic method, however, might not always give the best solution, but it guaranteed to find a good solution in a reasonable time. Heuristic function estimates how close a state is to the goal. It is represented by h(n), and it calculates the cost of an optimal path between the pair of states. The value of the heuristic function is always positive.

Admissibility of the heuristic function is given as:

`h(n) <= h\*(n)`

Here h(n) is heuristic cost, and h\*(n) is the estimated cost. Hence heuristic cost should be less than or equal to the estimated cost.

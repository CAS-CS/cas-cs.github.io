# What is Docker

Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. It provides a way to package software applications along with their dependencies into standardized units called containers. These containers are isolated and lightweight, providing a consistent environment for running applications across different operating systems and infrastructure.

Here are some key concepts related to Docker:

1. **Containerization:** Docker utilizes containerization technology to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained, isolated units called containers. Containers are lightweight and provide a consistent runtime environment, ensuring that applications run reliably across different systems.

2. **Images:** Docker images are the building blocks of containers. An image is a read-only template that contains the application code, runtime environment, libraries, and dependencies required to run an application. Images are stored in a registry and can be downloaded and used to create multiple containers.

3. **Containers:** Containers are the runtime instances of Docker images. They are isolated environments that encapsulate applications and their dependencies. Each container runs as an independent process, isolated from other containers and the underlying host system.

4. **Dockerfile:** A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions to build a Docker image. It defines the base image, application code, dependencies, and configuration required to create a Docker image. Dockerfiles provide a declarative and reproducible way to define the environment and setup for your applications.

5. **Docker Registry:** Docker registries are repositories that store Docker images. The default public registry is Docker Hub, which hosts a vast collection of pre-built Docker images. You can also set up private registries to store and distribute your own custom images.

6. **Docker Compose:** Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container applications using a YAML file. It simplifies the process of running interconnected containers and managing their configurations and dependencies.

7. **Orchestration:** Docker provides orchestration features through Docker Swarm and Kubernetes. These tools help manage and scale containerized applications across multiple hosts, providing features like service discovery, load balancing, and automatic scaling.

Docker revolutionized the way applications are developed, deployed, and managed by providing a standardized and portable platform for running applications in containers. It enables easier application deployment, promotes scalability, enhances development workflows, and fosters collaboration among teams working on different environments.

# Basic Commands

Certainly! Here are some commonly used Docker commands for managing containers:

1. **Image Management:**
- `docker pull <image>`: Download an image from a registry.
- `docker images`: List the downloaded images on your system.
- `docker rmi <image>`: Remove an image from your system.

2. **Container Lifecycle:**
- `docker run <image>`: Create and start a new container from an image.
- `docker ps`: List running containers.
- `docker stop <container>`: Stop a running container.
- `docker start <container>`: Start a stopped container.
- `docker restart <container>`: Restart a running container.
- `docker rm <container>`: Remove a stopped container.

3. **Container Interaction and Information:**
- `docker exec -it <container> <command>`: Run a command inside a running container.
- `docker logs <container>`: View the logs of a container.
- `docker inspect <container>`: Display detailed information about a container.
- `docker port <container>`: List the ports exposed by a container.

4. **Container Networking:**
- `docker network ls`: List the available networks.
- `docker network create <network>`: Create a new network.
- `docker network connect <network> <container>`: Connect a container to a network.
- `docker network disconnect <network> <container>`: Disconnect a container from a network.

5. **Docker Compose (for multi-container applications):**
- `docker-compose up`: Create and start containers defined in a Compose file.
- `docker-compose down`: Stop and remove containers defined in a Compose file.
- `docker-compose logs`: View the logs of containers defined in a Compose file.

These are just a few examples of Docker commands. Docker provides a wide range of functionality for container management and orchestration. You can explore more commands and options in the Docker documentation and reference guides.

# Dockerfile

Certainly! Here's an example of a Dockerfile along with an explanation of each option:

```Dockerfile
# Use a base image
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application files to the container
COPY . .

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y python3

# Expose a port for the application to listen on
EXPOSE 8000

# Specify the command to run when the container starts
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```

Explanation of each option:

1. `FROM`: Specifies the base image for the container. In this example, we're using the latest version of the Ubuntu image as the starting point for our container.

2. `WORKDIR`: Sets the working directory inside the container where subsequent commands will be executed. In this case, the working directory is set to `/app`.

3. `COPY`: Copies files from the host machine to the container. The `.` represents the current directory, so all files and directories in the current directory will be copied to the `/app` directory in the container.

4. `RUN`: Executes commands inside the container during the build process. Here, we update the package list using `apt-get update` and then install Python 3 using `apt-get install -y python3`.

5. `EXPOSE`: Informs Docker that the container will listen on the specified port(s) at runtime. In this case, port 8000 is exposed.

6. `CMD`: Specifies the command that will be run when the container starts. Here, we're running the command `python3 app.py` to start our application.

This Dockerfile example demonstrates the process of creating a Docker image for a simple Python application. It sets up the container environment, installs dependencies, exposes a port, and specifies the command to run the application.


To build an image using the Dockerfile, you can use the `docker build` command. Here's the command and its usage:

```bash
docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> <path_to_dockerfile>
```

- `-t <image_name>:<tag>`: Specifies the name and optional tag for the image you want to create. The name should be lowercase and can include a repository name or namespace. The tag is optional and often represents a version or label for the image.
- `<path_to_dockerfile>`: Specifies the path to the directory containing the Dockerfile. This is typically the current directory, represented by `.`.

Make sure you navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile before running the command. Here's an example of how to build an image using the Dockerfile from the previous example:

```bash
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
```

In this example, we're building an image with the name `myapp` and the tag `1.0` using the Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`). The resulting image will be tagged as `myapp:1.0`.

During the build process, Docker will execute each instruction in the Dockerfile, creating layers and caching the results for subsequent builds. Once the build is complete, you will have a new image available on your local Docker registry.

You can list your locally built images using the `docker images` command:

```bash
docker images
```

The output will display the details of the built image, including its repository, tag, and size.

That's how you can build an image using a Dockerfile. Remember to replace `<image_name>`, `<tag>`, and `<path_to_dockerfile>` with appropriate values based on your requirements.

# Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to define a set of services, their configurations, and their dependencies in a YAML file. With a single command, you can create and manage multiple containers that work together as a cohesive application.

Here's an example of a Docker Compose file for a FastAPI application:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - '8000:8000'
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=myuser
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword
      - POSTGRES_DB=mydb
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  db_data:
```

Explanation of the Docker Compose file:

- `version: '3'`: Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file syntax.

- `services`: Defines the individual services or containers in your application.

  - `app`: Defines the service for the FastAPI application.

    - `build`: Specifies the build configuration for the service.

      - `context: .`: Sets the build context to the current directory (where the Docker Compose file is located).

      - `dockerfile: Dockerfile`: Specifies the Dockerfile to use for building the image.

    - `ports`: Maps the host's port to the container's port. In this example, the application inside the container will be accessible on `localhost:8000`.

    - `volumes`: Mounts the current directory to the `/app` directory inside the container, allowing live code changes without rebuilding the image.

    - `depends_on`: Defines the dependency of the `app` service on the `db` service. Docker Compose ensures that the `db` service starts before the `app` service.

  - `db`: Defines the service for a PostgreSQL database.

    - `image: postgres:13`: Specifies the image to use for the `db` service.

    - `environment`: Sets the environment variables for the PostgreSQL container.

    - `volumes`: Mounts a volume to persist the PostgreSQL data.

- `volumes`: Defines the named volume `db_data` for persisting the PostgreSQL data.

To use this Docker Compose file, save it as `docker-compose.yml` in your project directory. Then, from the same directory, you can run the following command to start the application:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Docker Compose will build the Docker image for the FastAPI application, start the PostgreSQL container, and create the necessary network and dependencies between the services.

This example demonstrates how Docker Compose simplifies the management of multi-container applications by defining their configurations, dependencies, and network in a single YAML file.

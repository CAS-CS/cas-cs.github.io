# Journal, Paper and Author level metrics:

**Author-level** metrics are citation metrics that measure the bibliometric impact of individual authors, researchers, academics, and scholars. 

**Citation** is a reference to a source. 
* It is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears.

# What is H – index ?
‘H’ stands for **Hirsch** index as it was proposed by the *J.E. Hirsch* in 2005. 
* The h-index is defined as the author-level metric that attempts to measure both the productivity and the citation impact of the publication of the scientist or the scholar.

### There are two parameters to be considered 
1. Quantity – Numbers of papers
1. Quality – Number of citations

* H-index is the largest number such that a number of publications have at least the same number of citations.

* *H-index is always <= total numbers of papers published*

# I10-Index (or i10-index)

I10-Index is a sole metrics design and develop by **Google Scholar** and used in Google’s My Citations feature. 

It can be defined as follows:

> i10-Index = The number of publications with at least 10 citations

# Impact Factor (IF) (or Journal Impact Factor)

The impact factor (IF) or journal impact factor (JIF) of an academic journal is a scientometric index calculated by Clarivate that reflects the 

**yearly mean number of citations of articles published in the last two years in a given journal**, 

as indexed by [Clarivate's ](https://mjl.clarivate.com/home) [Web of Science](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/). 

*As a journal-level metric, it is frequently used as a proxy for the relative importance of a journal within its field; journals with higher impact factor values are given the status of being more important, or carry more prestige in their respective fields, than those with lower values.*

# Web of Science (WoS)

Web of Science(WoS) is an online subscription-based **Scientific Citation Indexing(SCI)** service originally produced by the **Institute for Scientific Information(ISI)** during 1964.

ISI was acquired by Thomson Scientific & Healthcare in 1992 and named Thomson Reuters Intellectual Property and Science Business, which became known as Thomson ISI, later it maintained by **Clarivate Analytics** to provides a comprehensive citation search of all indexing. 

### Categories in Web of Science

1. SCI:Science Citation Index Since(1964)
2. SCIE:Science Citation Index Expanded
3. ESCI:Emerging Sources Citation Index

# SCIE

The Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) is the larger version SCI which covers more than 8,500 notable and significant journals, across 150 disciplines, from **1900 to the present**.

> Based on the fact that Thomson Reuters selects journals of SCIE (including SCI) through a strict selection process, we hereby prove that journals of Science Citation Index® (SCI) and Science Citation Index ExpandedTM (SCIE) have the SAME QUALITY as the journal selection process for journals of SCI and SCIE is essentially identical.

The small difference between Science Citation Index® (SCI) and Science Citation Index ExpandedTM (SCIE) is the storage format. As known, both SCI and SCIE are available online. 

### SCI is available on CD/DVD format but SCIE is not.
---
# ESCI

The Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) was launched in late 2015 by Thomson Reuters as a new database in Web of Science.

This index was produced by Clarivate Analytics since 2017, which includes over 3,000 journals from various areas of research.

The journal’s index in this ESCI will not come with an impact factor(IF). However, each journal in this new index will be evaluated every year and those qualified will be transferred to SCIE.

The main aim of the ESCI is to ensure the important research works are visible in the Web of Science Core Collection even if it is not yet internationally recognized.

ESCI journals may have chances to be included in the SCIE when the journal continuously maintains its good quality of the publication

# Indexing in Web of Science (WoS) Requires 

1. Journals bibliographic metric should be in english.
2. Journal must be peer reviewed. 
        Blind fold review process:
            1. Single Blind fold
            2. Double Blind fold

# Q-index (Quartiles index) in SCOPUS indexed journals
Each subject category of journals is divided into four equal parts(25% each) quartiles.

Q1 is occupied by the top 25% of the journals in the list;

Q2 is occupied by the 25% of the journals in the 25% to 50% group;

Q3 is occupied by the 25% of the journals in the 50% to 75% group;

Q4 is occupied by the 25% of the journals in the 75% to 100% group;

> The most prestigious journals within a subject area are those which occupy the **first quartile, Q1**

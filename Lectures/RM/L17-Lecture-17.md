# What is Population?

In statistics, population is the entire set of items from which you draw data for a statistical study. 
> It can be a group of individuals, a set of items, etc. It makes up the data pool for a study.

in statistics, population refers to data on your study of interest. 

It can be a group of individuals, objects, events, organizations, etc. We (researchers) use populations to draw conclusions.

### If population is small and agrees to share data then the data collected will be complete and reliable.

# What is Sample? and Sampling
![PopulationAndSample_3](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/PopulationAndSample_2.png)

The process of collecting data from a small subsection of the population and then using it to generalize over the entire set is called Sampling.

Samples are used when :

*   The population is too large to collect data.

*   The data collected is not reliable.

*   The population is hypothetical and is unlimited in size. 


---
## A sample should generally :

*   Satisfy all different variations present in the population as well as a well-defined selection criterion.

*   unbiased

*   random

When to Collect Data From a Population?
--------------------------------------

You collect data from a population when your research question needs an extensive amount of data or information about every member of the population is available. 

You use population data when the data pool is small and cooperative to give all the required information. 

> ie. Now consider the census data collection, which takes place every 10 years. The government news is to count all the people living in India. However, rural areas and tribal villages might not be accessible by the census agents, leading to marginalized communities being left out. The data collected from the census is used to allocate resources, so this negatively affects these communities.

---
When to Collect Data From a Sample?
----------------------------------

Samples are used when the population is large, scattered, or if it's hard to collect data on individual instances within it. 

You can then use a small sample of the population to make overall hypotheses.

Samples should be **randomly selected and should represent the entire population** and every class within it. 

To ensure this, statistical methods such as probability sampling, are used to collect random samples from every class within the population.
This will **reduce sampling bias and increase validity. **

# Sampling and Non-sampling errors

**Sampling error** is one which occurs due to unrepresentativeness of the sample selected for observation. 

**non-sampling** error is an error arise from human error, such as error in problem identification, method or procedure used, etc.


---
An ideal research design seeks to control various types of error, but there are some potential sources which may affect it. 

In sampling theory, total error can be defined as the variation between the mean value of population parameter and the observed mean value obtained in the research. 

The total error can be classified into two categories, i.e. sampling error and non-sampling error.

# Scales of Measurement

## What is the scale

A scale is a device or an object used to measure or quantify any event or another object.


# Levels of Measurements

There are four different scales of measurement. 

Nominal Scale | Ordinal Scale | Interval Scale | Ratio Scale

Each level of measurement has some important properties that are useful to know.

---


**Properties of Measurement Scales:**

*   **Identity –** Each value on the measurement scale has a unique meaning.

*   **Magnitude –** Values on the measurement scale have an ordered relationship to one another. 
    >some values are larger and some are smaller.

*   **Equal intervals –** Scale units along the scale are equal to one another. 
    >*The difference between 1 and 2 would be equal to the difference between 11 and 12.*

*   **A minimum value of zero –** The scale has a true zero point, below which no values exist.
---
# Levels of Measurements
## **1\. Nominal Scale **  

Nominal variables can be placed into categories. 

These don’t have a numeric value and so cannot be added, subtracted, divided or multiplied. 

These also have no order, and nominal scale of measurement only satisfies the **identity** property of measurement.

>*For example, gender is an example of a variable that is measured on a nominal scale. Individuals may be classified as “male” or “female”, but neither value represents more or less “gender” than the other.*
---
# Levels of Measurements
## **2\. Ordinal Scale **

The ordinal scale contains things that you can place in order. 

It measures a variable in terms of magnitude, or rank. 

Ordinal scales tell us relative order, but give us no information regarding differences between the categories. 

The ordinal scale has the property of both **identity and magnitude.**

> *For example, in a race If Ram takes first and Vidur takes second place, we do not know competition was close by how many seconds.*

---
# Levels of Measurements
## **3\. Interval Scale**  
An interval scale has ordered numbers with meaningful divisions, the magnitude between the consecutive intervals are equal. 

>*Interval scales do not have a true zero i.e In Celsius 0 degrees does not mean the absence of heat.*

Interval scales have the properties of:

*   Identity
*   Magnitude
*   Equal distance

>*For example, temperature on Fahrenheit/Celsius thermometer i.e. 90° are hotter than 45° and the difference between 10° and 30° are the same as the difference between 60° degrees and 80°.*

---
# Levels of Measurements
## **4\. Ratio Scale **  
The ratio scale of measurement is similar to the interval scale in that it also represents quantity and has equality of units with one major difference: **zero is meaningful (no numbers exist below the zero)**. 

The true zero allows us to know how many times greater one case is than another. Ratio scales have all of the characteristics of the nominal, ordinal and interval scales. 

Properties of Ratio Scale:

*   Identity
*   Magnitude
*   Equal distance
*   Absolute/true zero

For example, in distance 10 miles is twice as long as 5 mile.

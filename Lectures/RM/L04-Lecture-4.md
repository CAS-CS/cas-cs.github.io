# Stages of research methodology

1. **Interest**:  Narrow area of research 

1. **Formulating and Clarifying : ** Identifying and Defining problem or problem statement.

1. **Reviewing Litrature**: Identify State-of-the-Art.

1. **Desing the research**: Define how to collect data, where from, who will respond.

1. **Data collection**: Survey, Experimentation readings, observations, design, etc.

1. **Analysing data**: Compile data, Performance analysis, and generate meaning full results.

1. **Writing**: Write report of findings. Structured according to type, ie. letter, article, desertation, thesis, bookchapter, or book.

# Important factors to consider:
* Avoide researchers bias

* Data access, ownership, usage rights and restrictions. 

* Time & other limited resources. ***Plan your timeline for different stages of research***

* Validity and reliability of the data: careful experimental recordings, no data tampering.

* Ethical issues:
      1. No harm to nature, plants, animals or humans.
      1. Plagarisim, self-plagarisim, proper citation.

# Types of research methodology

One of the most important decision is to select which methodology to use for your research problem, 
### Types of Research  

1. Fundamental (Basic or pure) or Applied
1. Descriptive vs. Analytical
1. Conceptual vs Emperical
2. Qualitative, Quantitative or a combination of the two. 

No matter the type of research, *the data gathered will be as numbers or descriptions*, and **researchers can choose to focus on collecting words, numbers or both**.

# Fundamental research

* Gathering knowledge for knowledge's sake, hence, termed "pure" or "basic".

* Usually done in universities.

* Research concerning about natual phenomenon, or pure mathematics.

* Study of humans to make generalisations about human behaviour.

  * **However, study of human behaviour for *specific social or business problem*,** 
  ie:   
      1. Facebook addictive behaviour analysis, 
      1. Amazon shopping pattern analysis, etc.
    
    * The study of human behaviour **to apply it for specific purpose** is considered as **Applied research**



---

# Applied research

Applied research aims at **finding a solution for an immediate problem** facing a society or an industrial/business organisation. ie.
  * Corona Vaccination.

1. Limited time
1. The central aim of applied research is to discover a solution for some pressing practical problem.
1. Its outcome has some specific application.

#   Descriptive vs. Analytical
| Descriptive |  Analytical|
|:---| :---|
| -  | |
|Includes surveys and fact-finding enquiries |Use facts or information already available|
| -  | |
|*Ex post facto* :the researcher has no control over the variables||
| -  | |
| Researcher can only report what has happened or what is happening | Analyze available info to make a critical evaluation of the material. | 
|ie. Social science, ecnomics and business research ||

# Conceptual vs Emperical

* ***Conceptual research*** is related to some abstract idea(s) or theory.
      * Generally used by thinkers and philosophers, to develop new concepts or to reinterpret existing ones.

* ***Emperical research*** relies on experience or observetion alone, often without due regard for system theory.
      * It is based on data and can be varified by observation or experiment.

# Qualitative

 Qualitative research involves **collecting and analyzing** written or spoken words and textual data. 

 It may also focus on body language or visual elements and help to create a detailed description of a researcher's observations. 

  Researchers usually gather qualitative data through **interviews, observation** and focus groups using a few carefully chosen participants.

   This research methodology is **subjective and more time-consuming** than using quantitative data. 

 Researchers often use a qualitative methodology when the aims and objectives of the research are **exploratory**. 
 
 *For example*, **when they perform research to understand human perceptions regarding an event, person or product.**





---

# Quantitative

Researchers usually use a quantitative methodology when the objective of the research is to confirm something. 

It focuses on collecting, testing and measuring numerical data, usually from a large sample of participants. 

They then analyze the data using statistical analysis and comparisons. Popular methods used to gather quantitative data are:

*   Surveys
*   Questionnaires
*   Test
*   Databases
*   Organizational records
  
This is often quicker.

#  Mixed-method

This contemporary research methodology combines quantitative and qualitative approaches to provide additional perspectives, create a richer picture and present multiple findings. 

The quantitative methodology provides definitive facts and figures, while the qualitative provides a human aspect. 

This methodology can produce interesting results as it presents exact data while also being exploratory.

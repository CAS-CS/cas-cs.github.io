# Journal, Paper and Author level metrics:

### Author-level

Author-level metrics are citation metrics that measure the bibliometric impact of individual authors, researchers, academics, and scholars. 

### Citation

Citation is a reference to a source. 
* It is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears.

# What is H-index ?
‘H’ stands for **Hirsch** index as it was proposed by the *J.E. Hirsch* in 2005. 
* The h-index is defined as the author-level metric that attempts to measure both the productivity and the citation impact of the publication of the scientist or the scholar.

### There are two parameters to be considered 
1. Quantity – Numbers of papers
1. Quality – Number of citations

* H-index is the largest number such that a number of publications have at least the same number of citations.

* *H-index is always <= total numbers of papers published*

# I10-Index (or i10-index)

I10-Index is a sole metrics design and develop by **Google Scholar** and used in Google’s My Citations feature. 

It can be defined as follows:

> i10-Index = The number of publications with at least 10 citations

# Impact Factor (IF) (or Journal Impact Factor)

The impact factor (IF) or journal impact factor (JIF) of an academic journal is a scientometric index calculated by Clarivate that reflects the 

**yearly mean number of citations of articles published in the last two years in a given journal**, as indexed by [Clarivate's ](https://mjl.clarivate.com/home) [Web of Science](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/). 

*As a journal-level metric, it is frequently used as a proxy for the relative importance of a journal within its field; journals with higher impact factor values are given the status of being more important, or carry more prestige in their respective fields, than those with lower values.*

# Web of Science (WoS)

Web of Science(WoS) is an online subscription-based **Scientific Citation Indexing(SCI)** service originally produced by the **Institute for Scientific Information(ISI)** during 1964.

ISI was acquired by Thomson Scientific & Healthcare in 1992 and named Thomson Reuters Intellectual Property and Science Business, which became known as Thomson ISI, later it maintained by **Clarivate Analytics** to provides a comprehensive citation search of all indexing. 

### Categories in Web of Science

1. SCI:Science Citation Index Since(1964)
2. SCIE:Science Citation Index Expanded
3. ESCI:Emerging Sources Citation Index

# SCIE

The Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) is the larger version SCI which covers more than 8,500 notable and significant journals, across 150 disciplines, from **1900 to the present**.

> Based on the fact that Thomson Reuters selects journals of SCIE (including SCI) through a strict selection process, we hereby prove that journals of Science Citation Index® (SCI) and Science Citation Index ExpandedTM (SCIE) have the SAME QUALITY as the journal selection process for journals of SCI and SCIE is essentially identical.

The small difference between Science Citation Index® (SCI) and Science Citation Index ExpandedTM (SCIE) is the storage format. As known, both SCI and SCIE are available online. 

### SCI is available on CD/DVD format but SCIE is not.
---
# ESCI

The Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) was launched in late 2015 by Thomson Reuters as a new database in Web of Science.

This index was produced by Clarivate Analytics since 2017, which includes over 3,000 journals from various areas of research.

The journal’s index in this ESCI will not come with an impact factor(IF). However, each journal in this new index will be evaluated every year and those qualified will be transferred to SCIE.

The main aim of the ESCI is to ensure the important research works are visible in the Web of Science Core Collection even if it is not yet internationally recognized.

ESCI journals may have chances to be included in the SCIE when the journal continuously maintains its good quality of the publication

# Indexing in Web of Science (WoS) Requires 

1. Journals bibliographic metric should be in english.
2. Journal must be peer reviewed. 
        Blind fold review process:
            1. Single Blind fold
            2. Double Blind fold

# Q-index (Quartiles index) in SCOPUS indexed journals
Each subject category of journals is divided into four equal parts(25% each) quartiles.

Q1 is occupied by the top 25% of the journals in the list;

Q2 is occupied by the 25% of the journals in the 25% to 50% group;

Q3 is occupied by the 25% of the journals in the 50% to 75% group;

Q4 is occupied by the 25% of the journals in the 75% to 100% group;

> The most prestigious journals within a subject area are those which occupy the **first quartile, Q1**

ISSN, ISBN, and DOI are unique identifiers used to distinguish and locate specific publications, including periodicals, books, and digital content. Here's an explanation of each with examples:

1. **ISSN (International Standard Serial Number):**
- **Purpose:** ISSN is used to identify serial publications, such as magazines, journals, newspapers, and newsletters. It helps ensure accurate and efficient retrieval of these publications.
- **Format:** ISSN consists of eight digits, typically divided into two groups of four digits separated by a hyphen. For example, "ISSN 1234-5678" for a print or online periodical.
- **Example:** The ISSN for the print version of the journal "Nature" is "ISSN 0028-0836," and the ISSN for the online version is "ISSN 1476-4687."

2. **ISBN (International Standard Book Number):**
- **Purpose:** ISBN is used to uniquely identify books, including print and digital books, making it easier to manage and sell them.
- **Formats:** There are two versions of ISBN:
    - **ISBN-10:** This format consists of ten digits (sometimes including an "X" as the last character). For example, "ISBN 0-13-601267-1" for a specific edition of a book.
    - **ISBN-13:** This format consists of thirteen digits, which includes the ISBN-10 information but with additional digits. For example, "ISBN-13: 978-0-13-601267-1" for the same book as above.

- **Example:** The book "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee has an ISBN-10 of "0-06-112008-9" and an ISBN-13 of "978-0-06-112008-4."

3. **DOI (Digital Object Identifier):**
- **Purpose:** DOI is used to uniquely identify digital content, such as scholarly articles, documents, and online resources, ensuring persistent access and citation of these materials.
- **Format:** A DOI is typically in the form of a string of characters and numbers. For example, "10.1000/182" or "doi:10.1234/5678."
- **Example:** The DOI for a research article titled "The Impact of Climate Change on Biodiversity" might be "10.1234/5678," and it's often presented as a clickable link or as part of a citation in academic articles.

In summary, these identifiers play essential roles in organizing and referencing publications:

- **ISSN:** Used for serial publications (e.g., journals).
- **ISBN:** Used for books, with two versions (ISBN-10 and ISBN-13).
- **DOI:** Used for digital content, particularly scholarly articles, ensuring reliable and permanent access.

It's important to use the correct identifier for the type of publication you're dealing with, as this helps streamline access and reference materials in various fields of study and industries.

# How to verify journal indexing 
To verify if a journal is genuinely indexed in the Science Citation Index (SCI), you can follow these steps:

1. **Check the Journal's Website:**
Start by visiting the official website of the journal. Look for information about their indexing and impact factor. Reputable journals will prominently display their indexing information.

2. **Use Clarivate's Web of Science:**
The SCI is part of Clarivate's Web of Science database. You can use Web of Science to check if a journal is indexed. Here's how:
- Go to the Web of Science website (https://www.webofscience.com/).
- In the search bar, enter the journal's title or ISSN (International Standard Serial Number).
- If the journal is indexed, it should appear in the search results with citation data and indexing information.

3. **Consult the Master Journal List:**
Clarivate also maintains a Master Journal List that provides a comprehensive list of journals indexed in Web of Science. You can check this list to verify if the journal is included. The list is available on the Web of Science website.

4. **Check Other Trusted Databases:**
Apart from Web of Science, some other reputable databases index journals. Examples include Scopus and PubMed. You can search these databases to verify the journal's indexing status.

5. **Contact the Journal's Publisher:**
If you are still unsure about a journal's indexing status, you can contact the journal's publisher directly and ask for confirmation. Reputable publishers will provide this information.

6. **Consult Academic Institutions and Librarians:**
Academic institutions and university libraries often maintain lists of indexed journals. You can reach out to a librarian or an academic department for assistance in verifying the journal's indexing.

7. **Check for Consistency and Quality:**
Ensure that the journal maintains editorial and publishing standards, peer review processes, and ethical guidelines. Reputable indexed journals follow strict quality standards.

8. **Beware of Predatory Journals:**
Be cautious about journals that claim to be indexed in SCI but do not appear in reputable databases or have a dubious publication process. Predatory journals often make false claims about their indexing status.

Remember that the presence of a journal in an indexing database is not a guarantee of its quality. It's essential to assess the journal's reputation and impact within your specific field of study. Scholarly societies and academic experts in your field can also provide valuable insights into the legitimacy and quality of a journal.

Verifying a journal's indexing status is crucial to ensure that your research is published in respected and recognized outlets.

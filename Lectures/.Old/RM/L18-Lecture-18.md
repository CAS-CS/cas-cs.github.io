### **Hypothesis** are statement about the given problem. 

**Hypothesis testing** is a statistical method that is used in making a statistical decision using experimental data. 

Hypothesis testing is basically an assumption that we make about a population parameter. 

It evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement is best supported by the sample data.  

**Example:**  

>Average student in the class is 30 OR

>A boy is taller than girls.

# Parameters of hypothesis testing

*   **Null hypothesis(H0):** In statistics, the null hypothesis is a general given statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured cases or no relationship among groups.  
    >In other words, it is a basic assumption made based on the prior knowledge.  
    Example: A company production is = 50 unit/per day etc.


*   **Alternative hypothesis(H1):** The alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis used in hypothesis testing that is contrary to the null hypothesis.  
    >Example : A company production is not equal to 50 unit/per day etc.

# Parameters of hypothesis testing
*   **Level of significance**:  It refers to the degree of significance in which we accept or reject the null-hypothesis. 

100% accuracy is not possible for accepting a hypothesis, so we, therefore, select a level of significance that is usually 5%. 

This is normally denoted with alpha ![\alpha](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-091e0ab996bb6a7f0e720b84e9aee36f_l3.svg) and generally, it is 0.05 or 5%, which means your output should be 95% confident to give similar kind of result in each sample.

# Parameters of hypothesis testing
*   **P-value**  
    The P value, or calculated probability, is the probability of finding the observed/extreme results when the null hypothesis(H0) of a study given problem is true. 
    
    If your P-value is less than the chosen significance level then you reject the null hypothesis 
    **i.e. accept that your sample claims to support the alternative hypothesis.**

# **Error in Hypothesis Testing**

###   **Type I error:** 
When we reject the null hypothesis, although that hypothesis was true. Type I error is denoted by alpha.


###   **Type II errors:** 
When we accept the null hypothesis but it is false. Type II errors are denoted by beta.

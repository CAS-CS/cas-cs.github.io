Types of sampling design in research methodology
------------------------------------------------

When creating a sample design, a researcher decides from who or what they'll collect data. 

They also choose the techniques and procedures they'll use to select items or individuals for the sample. 

There are several types of sample design that fall into **two main categories**:
1. Probability sampling
1. Nonprobability sampling
---

### Probability sampling

This sampling method uses a **random sample** from the pool of people or items you're interested in, called the population, and is random or chance sampling. 

Every person or item in the population has an equal chance of being selected. 

Using this method is the best way to get a truly representative sample, and researchers can generalize the study's results to the entire population.





---
### Nonprobability sampling

Nonprobability sampling is **not random**, as the researcher deliberately selects people or items for the sample. 

Researchers also refer to this method as deliberate sampling, judgment sampling or purposive sampling. 

Every person or item in the population doesn't have an equal chance of being selected, and the results are typically not generalizable to the entire population.

# Common data collection methods

Once a researcher has finalized their population sample, they need to decide how to collect data. 

There are several options for data collection, however, the best research method to use will depend on the ***research topic, methodology, type of data and the population sample***.

---
## Major data collection methods:
**Interviews : ** Researchers can carry out interviews in a structured, semi-structured, or unstructured format, depending on how formal the **questions** are.

**Surveys : ** Surveys/**forms** can be online or in-person and have either free-answer, essay-style questions, or closed, multiple-choice style questions. Depending on the data required, a survey could also use a mixture.

**Focus groups : ** Focus groups have interviewees give their thoughts, opinions, perspectives and perceptions on specific topics. *A moderator usually leads the group to help guide the discussion and ensure everyone speaks.*
   
**Observations : ** Direct observation involves observing the **spontaneous behavior** of participants **without interference** from the researcher, while participant observation is more structured, and the researcher interacts with the participants.

**Documents and records : ** Researchers collect data such as **published reports** and **official documents** of international bodies, government agencies or private institutes and **internal records** such as employees' payroll, raw material quantities and cash receipts.

# Common data analysis methods


Researchers use different data analysis methods depending on whether the data is qualitative or quantitative. For example:
1. Qualitative data analysis
1. Quantitative data analysis



---
# 1. Qualitative data analysis

Qualitative data is usually in spoken or written information, such as interview transcripts, video and audio recordings, notes, images and text documents. 

Qualitative data analysis involves identifying common patterns in participants' responses and critically analyzing them to achieve research aims and objectives.

---
The most commonly used qualitative data analysis methods are:
------
*   **Content analysis**: This is one of the most common methods used to analyze documented information and is usually used to analyze interviewees' responses.
    
*   **Narrative analysis**: Researchers use this method to analyze content from several sources, including interviews, observations and surveys. It focuses on using people's stories and experiences to answer research questions.
    
*   **Discourse analysis**: This method analyzes spoken or written language in its social context and aims to understand how people use language in day-to-day situations.
    
*   **Grounded theory**: This method uses qualitative data to discover or construct a theory explaining why something happened. It uses a comparative analysis of data from similar cases in different settings to derive explanations.
    
---
# 2. Quantitative data analysis

Quantitative data analysis involves turning numbers into meaningful data by applying rational and critical thinking. Most researchers use analytical software to assist with quantitative data analysis. 

The first stage in analyzing quantitative data is validating, editing and coding the data. Once completed, the data is ready for analysis.

The most commonly used quantitative data analysis methods are:

*   **Descriptive analysis**: This method uses descriptive statistics like mean, median, mode, percentage, frequency and range to find patterns.
    
*   **Inferential analysis**: This method shows the relationships between multiple variables using correlation, regression and variance analysis.

# Factors to consider when choosing a RM

### **The research objective**: 
Consider the research project objective. **When researchers know what information they require at the end of the project** to meet their objectives, it helps them select the correct methodology and research method.
    
### **Significance of statistics**: 
Another factor to consider is whether you require concise, data-driven research results and statistical answers. Or whether the research questions require an understanding of reasons, perceptions, opinions and motivations.
    
### **Nature of the research**: 
If the aims and objectives are exploratory, the research will probably require qualitative data collection methods. However, if the aims and objectives are to measure or test something, the research will require quantitative data collection methods.

# Factors to consider when choosing a RM


### **Sample size**: 
How big does the sample need to be to answer the research questions and meet the objectives? The sample size can determine your data-gathering methods, such as whether to use in-person interviews or smaller samples or online surveys for larger ones.
    
### **Time available**: 
If there are time constraints, consider techniques like random or convenience sampling and tools that allow for data collection in a few days. If there's more time available for data collection, in-person interviews and observations are possible.

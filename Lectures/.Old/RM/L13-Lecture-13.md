# Research Process
> It consists mainly 8 Steps.

These can be partitioned in to 3 phases.
---
# Research Process
#### PHASE I DECIDING WHAT TO RESEARCH
* Step I *Formulating a research problem*

#### PHASE II PLANNING A RESEARCH STUDY
*  Step II *Conceptualising a research design* 
*  Step III *Constructing an instrument for data collection* 
*  Step IV *Selecting a sample*  
* Step V *Writing a research proposal* 

#### PHASE III CONDUCTING A RESEARCH STUDY
*  Step VI *Collecting data *
* Step VII *Processing and displaying data *
* Step VIII *Writing a research report *

# Step I *Formulating a research problem*

It consists of 4 steps:
1. Reviewing the literature

1. Formulating a research problem

1. Identifying variables

1. Constructing hypotheses

---

# Reviewing the literature

1. It provides a **theoretical background** to your study.

1. It helps you establish the links between what **you are proposing** to examine and what has
**already been studied**.

1. It enables you to show how your findings have **contributed to the existing body of knowledge**
in your profession. It helps you to integrate your research findings into the existing body of
knowledge.



---
## The literature review can help in four ways.

It can:
1. bring clarity and focus to your research problem.

1. improve your research methodology.

1. broaden your knowledge base in your research area, and

1. contextualise your findings.

---
# How to review the literature

> If you **do not have a specific research problem**, you should **review the literature in your broad
area** of interest with the **aim of gradually narrowing it down** to what you want to find out
about.

The literature review should be focused around your research problem. 

*Reviewing the literature without having a **reasonably specific idea** of what you want to study is not research*


---
# Four steps involved in conducting a literature review:
1. Searching for the existing literature in your area of study.

2. Reviewing the selected literature.

3. Developing a theoretical framework.

4. Developing a conceptual framework.


> The skills required for these tasks are different.  
*Developing theoretical and conceptual
frameworks is more difficult than the other tasks.*


---
# Searching for the existing literature

* Books
* Journals
* Internet

The material published in books is usually important
and of good quality. 
*However, the material is not
completely up to date, as **it can take a few years between the completion** of a work and its publication in the form of a book.*


### Keyword search / Back reference

Most search facilities use Boolean logic, which allows
three types of basic search “AND”, “OR” and “NOT”. With practice you will become more
efficient and effective in using keywords in combination with AND, OR and NOT, and so
learn to narrow your search to help you identify the most relevant references.


---

# Reviewing the selected literature

After identifying several books and articles as useful, 

> the next step is to start reading them critically to pull together themes and issues that are of relevance to you.

#### Use separate sheets of paper (or spreadsheet column) for each theme (or issue you) identify as you go through selected reference, books, or articles.



---
# Developing a theoretical framework

Examining the literature can be a never-ending task, but as you have limited time it is important to set parameters by reviewing the literature in relation to some main themes.

The information obtained from different books and journals  needs to be sorted under the main themes and theories, 
**highlighting agreements and disagreements among the authors and ** ***identifying the unanswered questions or gaps***.

>Until you go through the literature you cannot develop a theoretical framework,
and until you have developed a theoretical framework you cannot effectively review the
literature. 

**The solution is to read some of the literature and then attempt to develop a framework, even a loose one, within which you can organize the rest of the literature you read. **
*The framework will change as you gain more knowledge about your research area.*

---

# Developing a conceptual framework

The conceptual framework is the basis of your research problem. 

It stems from the theoretical framework and usually focuses on the section(s) which become the basis of your study.

Whereas the theoretical framework consists of the theories or issues in which your study is embedded, **the conceptual framework describes the aspects you selected from the theoretical framework to become the basis of your enquiry**











---
# Writing about the literature reviewed
#### State-of-The-Art | Survey Paper | Literature Review.

The broad functions of a literature review are 
1. To provide a theoretical background to your study and 
2. To enable you to contextualize your findings in relation to the existing body of knowledge.

To fulfil the first purpose, you should identify and describe various theories relevant to your field; and specify gaps
in existing knowledge in the area, recent advances in the area of study, current trends and so on.

To comply with the second function you should integrate the results from your study with specific and relevant findings from the existing literature by comparing the two for confirmation
or contradiction

** You can start with the first stage, however, for second you have to wait for the results of your research.**
